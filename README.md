# Axys - super-user oriented task manager
Axys is an experimental task- and project manager tool made with the goal of being as optimized for super-users as possible. This means that ideally all functionality, all viewable data and all interactions should be possible to access or interact with through keyboard-shortcuts in addition to the UI.

Made with **React**, **Apollo**, **GraphQL** and **MongoDB**.

**Current features or work in progress:**
- personal task manager
- connect with other users to collaborate
- assign people in your network to tasks, discuss tasks through comments or reactions to comments.
- customize your experience by changing the visual theme of the webapplication
- collaborative projects with multiple users
